*The star of this new story is a 24-year-old man who runs a problem-solving business. He often takes on jobs that have him dealing with the grey area at the edge of legality. Depending on your actions, he may find himself working alongside the police, the mafia, or even some mysterious factions that are just as grey as him*

***Dive into the dynamic adventure in "Trails through Daybreak!"*** ðŸ‘‰

Trails through Daybreak seamlessly blends real-time action and turn-based combat to create a new pinnacle for the Trails series.

New players will find themselves drawn in to the intricately-built world and well-designed combat systems, while series veterans will be able to enjoy a refinement of everything they love about Trails.

The Trails series' traditional AT battles have been enhanced to be more action-packed than ever! The field attacks present in previous titles are now full-on field battles, letting you choose to dispatch enemies in real time.

Enjoy the perfect blend of speed and strategy in your battles!

After the war, Calvard is enjoying unprecedented economic prosperity. However, the public grows uncertain as the number of immigrants increases and political reform runs rampant. Follow Van, a young man and local spriggan, on a unique request that will prove more than he bargained for. Will the nation fall into chaos?

The AT (Action Time) battle command has been completely revamped transitioning seamlessly from field battles to turn-based combat. The sixth-generation tactical orbment Xipha offers a revolutionary combat experience unique to this iteration of the Trails series!

In addition, the Topic System allows players to gain an advantage in battle by using conversation topics as bargaining chips. These topics can be obtained by interacting with other characters throughout the city. The game also features the Alignment system, which allows players to change their characterâ€™s three unique attributes and influence characteristics such as their status, the forces they fight with (or against), and even how the plot unfolds.

The spriggan's life is but one of many professions that has emerged from the Calvard Republic. Be it playing detective, negotiator, or bounty hunter, Van Arkride takes on the kind of work that can't be taken to more legitimate sources. It could be something the police can't handle, work that's best left out of the public eye, or even a request from a criminal of organization in the underworld; so long as it pays and doesn't cross too far over the gray line, he'll accept near-any job that comes across his table.
